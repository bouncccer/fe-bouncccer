# Why Quinty?

The traditional work economy is broken. Quinty fixes it with trustless infrastructure, soulbound reputation, and zero platform fees.

## The Problems We Solve

### Problem 1: Trust Deficit in Remote Work

**Traditional Platform Model:**

- Creator posts job → Solver completes work → Creator "might" pay
- Payment risk: 30-40% of freelancers report non-payment
- Dispute resolution takes weeks/months
- Platform takes 20-30% fee for "trust"

**Quinty's Solution:**

- ✅ **100% Escrow** - Funds locked upfront in smart contracts
- ✅ **Automatic Slashing** - Creator forced to resolve or lose funds
- ✅ **Community Disputes (coming soon)** - Fair resolution in 3-7 days, not months
- ✅ **0% Platform Fees** - Trust enforced by code, not corporations

### Problem 2: Reputation Hostage

**Traditional Platforms:**

- Your 5-star rating lives on Upwork's servers
- Switch platforms → Start from zero
- Platform bans you → Reputation gone forever
- Can't prove your history outside the platform

**Quinty's Solution:**

- ✅ **Soulbound NFTs** - Reputation lives in your wallet
- ✅ **Portable History** - Works across any platform reading Base
- ✅ **Permanent Proof** - Can never be deleted or taken away
- ✅ **Self-Sovereign** - You own your achievements

### Problem 3: Centralized Dispute Resolution

**Traditional Platforms:**

- Support ticket → Wait days → Arbitrary decision → No appeal
- Platform has financial incentive to side with bigger spenders
- No transparency in decision-making process
- Creators/solvers have no voice

**Quinty's Solution (coming soon):**

- ✅ **Community Voting** - Stakers vote on disputes
- ✅ **Stake-Weighted** - Economic alignment (voters lose stake if wrong)
- ✅ **Transparent** - All votes and outcomes on-chain
- ✅ **Fair Rewards** - Both winners and correct voters earn from slashed funds

### Problem 4: High Fees

**Traditional Platforms Take:**

- Upwork: 20% fee (10% from freelancer, 10% from client)
- Fiverr: 20% fee from freelancer
- GoFundMe: 2.9% + $0.30 per donation + platform fee
- Kickstarter: 5% fee + payment processing

**Quinty Charges:**

- ✅ **0% Platform Fees**
- ✅ **Only Gas Costs** (~$0.01-$0.10 on Mantle)
- ✅ **All Value to Creators/Solvers**
- ✅ **No Hidden Charges**

### Problem 5: Slow Payments

**Traditional Flow:**

- Complete work → Submit → Wait for approval → Request payment → Wait for processing → Bank transfer (3-5 days)
- Freelancers wait 2-4 weeks on average for payment

**Quinty Flow:**

- Work selected → Instant on-chain transfer (2 seconds)
- Funds in your wallet immediately
- No intermediary processing
- No bank delays

### Problem 6: Limited Funding Models

**Traditional Options:**

- Freelance: One-off tasks only
- Grants: Centralized, opaque selection
- Crowdfunding: All-or-nothing, no accountability
- VC Funding: Equity dilution, limited access

**Quinty Offers:**

- ✅ **Bounties** - Task-based work with escrow
- ✅ **Grant Programs** - Transparent, structured grants
- ✅ **Crowdfunding** - Milestone-based accountability
- ✅ **Looking for Grant** - Flexible VC funding without equity
